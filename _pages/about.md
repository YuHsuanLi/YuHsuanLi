Robots can be valuable helpers for humans, and vision is a fundamental sensor that enables them to perceive the world.  

I am an MSCV student at Carnegie Mellon University with a passion for both learning-based methods and control theory algorithms. I thrive on exploring diverse knowledge and innovative ideas.  

Before joining CMU, I worked as a software engineer at Tron Future Tech for over two years. During my time there, I contributed to several products, with a primary focus on T.Cam. My contributions included designing data flow, implementing control algorithms, and developing detection models.
