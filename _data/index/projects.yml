- name: Make an Omelette with Breaking Eggs:Zero-Shot Learning for Novel Attribute Synthesis
  i18n: zsla
  # url: https://yuhsuanli.github.io/ZSLA/
  github: https://github.com/YuHsuanLi/ZSLA
  project_page: https://yuhsuanli.github.io/ZSLA/
  paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.14182
  poster: https://github.com/YuHsuanLi/ZSLA/blob/master/poster.pdf

  desc:  This project aims to minimize the manual labeling expenses associated with Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) classification tasks. To achieve this, we have proposed a novel decompose-and-reassemble approach. I am delighted to share that our work has been accepted at NeurIPS 2022, a prestigious conference in the field. This accomplishment highlights our contribution to advancing research in ZSL and underscores our commitment to finding innovative solutions for reducing labeling costs.

  desc:  In this project, we have successfully replicated the results of the Maximum a Posteriori Policy Optimization (MPO) method proposed by DeepMind. To enhance comprehension, we have created an informative slide deck that thoroughly explains the implementation and outcomes of our work. Please explore the slides to gain a comprehensive understanding of our replication project.

  desc: This project represents an innovative approach to music accompaniment generation for singing. Through extensive research, we have developed a novel method that involves transforming music waves into spectrograms. Additionally, we employ a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) structure to disentangle the spectrogram, utilizing vocal information as a condition.
  # We develop a novel method on music accompaniment generation of singing by transferring music wave to spectrogram and then utilzing CVAE structure to disentangle the spectrogram with vocal information as the condition.

- name: Fish Tracking
  i18n: fish_tracking
  github: https://github.com/YuHsuanLi/fish_tracking
  desc: This project was undertaken in collaboration with Dr. Chang-Chieh Cheng and Dr. Yi-Bing Lin, with the objective of enhancing the IoTtalk system. Our primary focus was on developing a new functionality that incorporated an object detection model to accurately identify the location of pets. This innovative feature enables pet owners to conveniently monitor their pets remotely.
