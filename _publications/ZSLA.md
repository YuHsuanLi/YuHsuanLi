This project aims to minimize the manual labeling expenses associated with Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) classification tasks. To achieve this, we have proposed a novel decompose-and-reassemble approach. I am delighted to share that our work has been accepted at NeurIPS 2022, a prestigious conference in the field. This accomplishment highlights our contribution to advancing research in ZSL and underscores our commitment to finding innovative solutions for reducing labeling costs.
