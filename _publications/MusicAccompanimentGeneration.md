This project represents an innovative approach to music accompaniment generation for singing. Through extensive research, we have developed a novel method that involves transforming music waves into spectrograms. Additionally, we employ a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) structure to disentangle the spectrogram, utilizing vocal information as a condition.
